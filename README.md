# Lease Mileage Calculator

This app calculates the approximate number of miles the user's lease allows 
for as of the current date. In this calculation, it accounts for the car 
purchase date and the yearly number of miles the lease allows for.

For convenience, once the user enters the information, it is saved and does 
not have to be reentered each time the app is launched. This allows the user 
to easily track the number of miles they should be under on demand.
